# PowerBI-SQL-ZOMATO-DATA-ANALYS
The aim of this project is to analyze the Zomato dataset in order to understand  the key aspects of Zomato's business. The dataset contains more than 9000  rows with various columns such as Restaurant_id, Restaurant_name, City,  Location, Cuisines, and more. Through SQL  and POWERBI i will perform several tasks to gain insights into the dataset. 
During the analysis of the Zomato dataset, several observations were made: 
The dataset consists of various details related to restaurants such as names, locations, cuisines, and ratings. 
Duplicate entries in the RestaurantId column were identified and removed to ensure clean data. 
Unwanted columns were eliminated to focus only on relevant attributes. 
The dataset was enriched by merging two tables and including the Country_Name column. 
Misspelled city names were corrected to maintain data accuracy. 
The count of restaurants was calculated using functions. 
Statistical measures such as minimum, maximum, and average were calculated for votes, rating, and currency columns. 
A new category column was created to group restaurants based on their ratings. 

This repository contains an interactive dashboard created using Power BI. The dashboard provides a visually pleasing and insightful representation of data where we can see the Total Resturant, Total country, Total cities, average cost for two , top 5 Rating by cities, top 5 rating by country name, and many more. 
Overall, this analysis provides valuable insights into Zomato's business, allowing for a better understanding of their operations and market presence.
